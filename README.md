This is a Kosmo format module that is a combined buffered multiple and mixer. 
The multiple section has 1 input, 5 outputs, and an LED. The input is buffered to the 5 outputs, and the LED is used to show the state of the signal.

In the mixer section, there are 5 inputs and one output. Each input has its own pot and switch. The pot acts as an attenuator, and the switch disconnects that input from the main output.

This module is based on the [LMNC Buffered Multiple](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/1161-buffered-multiple) and the [LMNC Mini Mixer](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects#/1163-mini-mixer). Much credit to Sam for open-sourcing his modules!
